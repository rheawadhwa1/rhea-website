            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>Hi! Iâ€™m <b>Rhea Wadhwa</b>, a third-year student at Northeastern University studying Finance and Data Science.
               I grew up in Stamford, CT with my parents, younger sister and Maltipoo named Zayn. I'm really interested in tech, finance
               and life sciences/healthcare, which comprehensively fuel my passion to pursue life sciences PE later down the line. </p>
           
            <p>Outside of academics and school, I'm passionate about all sports (I've played on ~10 different kinds of sports teams throughout my life) and competitive dance. 
               This passion led me to founding a competitive Bollywood-fusion dance team on campus. This leadership position, as well as others I hold on the boards of other clubs/organizations
               have taught me valuable lessons I hadn't expected to uncover during my time at Northeastern, but am extremely grateful for. I really enjoy volunteering, specifically 
               within the Type 1 Diabetes community, and plan to continue building on my impact through my professional pursuits as well.</p>
          
            <p>A little fun fact about me: I have hiked Mount Vesuvius (the volcano that wiped out Pompeii).
               I love meeting new people and putting myself in initially uncomfortable situations where I'm forced to do so as there's so much that can be learned and shared. 
               I'll be moving to NYC this August for co-op and look forward to carrying this enthusiasm with me there!</p>
