                    <b>Incoming Private Equity Analyst at HarbourVest Partners</b><br>
                    I will work closely with the Private Equity Secondaries team to build memos for IC meetings, develop financial models, and conduct due diligence on PE portfolios we may consider investing in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Incoming Healthcare Investment Banking Analyst at Provident Healthcare Partners</b><br>
                    I will be working with the NYC team to develop financial models, comprehensive memos and presentations for clients, sit in on meetings and overall understand how sell-side M&A works, specifically from a healthcare IB perspective. This will give me good exposure to what I hope to do later.

                <li>
                    <b>FP&A Analyst at State Street</b><br>
                    I maintained our headcount and expense tracker, and built exhibits and models centered around the budgeting constraints we needed to follow. I then reached out to teams and helped my team stay on track to actually meeting the budget through the implementation process. I also developed a financial model demonstrating how organic, inorganic and M&A growth would affect CAGR down the line and performed scenario analysis. 
                <li>
                    <b>Venture Capital Analyst Intern at Sure Ventures</b><br>
                    I developed a financial model demonstrating how leveraging would impact our 10 year returns, understanding how different terms like carry and follow-on investments all came into play. I also helped with sourcing, conducting due diligence and evaluating seed stage startups we would hear from.
